# Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews-Topic-Modeling
Topic modeling and text summarization of Amazon food reviews using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

**Project Overview**\n
In the age of digital consumerism, online reviews play a crucial role in shaping product perception and influencing purchasing decisions. This project focuses on topic modeling and text summarization of Amazon Fine Food Reviews, leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques to extract meaningful insights from large volumes of textual data.

The primary objective is to analyze customer feedback to identify common themes, sentiments, and trends within food reviews, thereby enhancing the understanding of consumer preferences and improving product offerings.

**Objectives**
Topic Modeling: Utilize clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to uncover latent topics within food reviews.
Text Summarization: Develop a sequence-to-sequence LSTM model to generate concise summaries of lengthy reviews, making it easier for consumers to glean essential information.
Visual Insights: Present findings through clear visualizations to enhance understanding of the data.

**Technologies Used**
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Framework: Keras
Modeling Techniques: LSTM, TF-IDF
Clustering Algorithms: K-Means, LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
Dimensionality Reduction: t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Data Overview**
The analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset of Amazon food reviews, which typically includes:

Review IDs
Product information (name, brand, category)
Review text
Ratings
Review timestamps
These features provide a rich context for understanding customer opinions and preferences regarding various food products.

**Methodology**
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Acquisition: Gather the dataset from Amazon’s public API or web scraping to compile a comprehensive collection of food reviews.
Data Cleaning: Clean the text data by removing unnecessary characters, handling missing values, and normalizing text for consistency.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Exploration: Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of ratings, review lengths, and common words or phrases in the reviews.
Visualization: Use visual tools to highlight significant patterns, such as the most frequently mentioned products or common sentiments.

3. Topic Modeling
Clustering Techniques:
K-Means: Group similar reviews together to identify common themes.
LDA: Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation to uncover hidden topics within the reviews.
Dimensionality Reduction: Use t-SNE to visualize high-dimensional data in a two-dimensional space, making it easier to interpret the clustering results.

4. Text Summarization
LSTM Model: Build a Sequence-to-Sequence Encoder-Decoder model using Keras for summarizing lengthy reviews into concise summaries. This allows users to quickly grasp the main points without reading through all the details.

5. Results and Insights
Extracted Topics: Analyze the topics identified through clustering techniques and provide examples of prominent themes in the food reviews.
Summarized Text: Present examples of summarized reviews, showcasing the model’s effectiveness in condensing information.

**Key Insights**
Consumer Preferences: The analysis reveals prevalent themes in food reviews, helping manufacturers understand what customers value most in their products.
Sentiment Trends: By summarizing reviews, stakeholders can quickly gauge overall customer sentiment toward specific food items, allowing for more informed product decisions.

**Future Work**
Sentiment Analysis: Integrate sentiment analysis to categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, further enhancing insights into consumer opinions.
Real-Time Analysis: Develop a real-time dashboard to monitor new reviews and update topic models and summaries dynamically.
Broaden Dataset: Expand the analysis to include reviews from other platforms to gain a more comprehensive view of consumer preferences across the food industry.

**Conclusion**
This project exemplifies the power of machine learning and deep learning techniques in extracting meaningful insights from consumer reviews. By effectively summarizing and modeling topics, we can provide valuable information to stakeholders, ultimately leading to improved products and enhanced customer satisfaction.
